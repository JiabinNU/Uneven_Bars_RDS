# cart_pendulum_template
Cart-pendulum template for Robot Design Studio 2020

## Overview
Application entry point is `main.m`, which calls (through wrapper functions) dynamics-related functions that are automatically generated by running `derive_equations.m`.
That means you have to run `derive_equations.m` before you run `main.m` for the first time.
The workflow is depicted below.
